        Comparing hashtable implementations performance by setting and accessing
        english words one by one
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Array based hashtable with open addressing with precalculated array
          size
        </li>
        <li>Linked List based hashtable with separate chaining</li>
        <li>JS native Object</li>
        <li>JS native Map</li>
        <li>
          Rust WebAssembly Native HashMap (without any optimizations with direct
          string passing from JS to wasm)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        JS object is basically a hashtable, but Map has some additional
        opimizations and should be faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Rust WebAssembly HashMap, the biggest overhead probably comes from
        communitation - JS cannot direct pass a string, must encode it first.
      </p>
      <p>Clearly Map is faster than any of other implementations</p>
